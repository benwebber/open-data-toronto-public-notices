The Bloor-Lansdowne GO/SmartTrack station is part of the SmartTrack program, which is a collaboration between the Province of Ontario, the City of Toronto, and Metrolinx for implementing new GO Stations in Toronto. The station will be located on the Metrolinx-Barrie rail corridor, connecting with destinations such as Caledonia, Downsview Park, Aurora, Newmarket, Barrie and Union Station. The station will also be served with two-way all-day increased service frequency as part of the GO Expansion plan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main entrance building will be located at 1325 Bloor Street West, which is planned to abut a new mixed-use tall building development on an adjacent property at 1319 Bloor Street West. A maintenance building with bicycle parking and a waste and recycling storage area will be located at 17 Dora Avenue. Other station elements, including the east and west platforms, waiting enclosures, a pedestrian tunnel from the main entrance building to access the westerly platform, stairs and elevators, will be located within the rail corridor. The station design also includes a multi-use path (MUP) running parallel to the east side of the railway corridor from south of Dublin Street to Bloor Street West. This MUP is proposed to continue north to Paton Road. This segment is not included in the properties subject to this application.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This land is also subject to an application under the Planning Act for minor variance. Application Number A0225/25 TEY.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting Katrien Darling, Senior Planner at 416-396-7019, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Katrien.Darling@toronto.ca\">Katrien.Darling@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at: <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/application-details/?id=5608235&amp;pid=163380&amp;title=1325%20BLOOR%20ST%20W%20AND%2017%20DORA%20AVE\">https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/application-details/?id=5608235&amp;pid=163380&amp;title=1325%20BLOOR%20ST%20W%20AND%2017%20DORA%20AVE</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the application.
