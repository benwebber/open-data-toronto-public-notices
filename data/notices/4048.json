  "noticeDescription": "<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>NOTICE OF INTENTION TO DESIGNATE THE PROPERTY</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 15 Elm Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 15 Elm Street is worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for its cultural heritage value, and meets Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design and physical, historical and associative and contextual values.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>Located on the south side of Elm Street between Yonge and Bay streets in the city's first immigrant neighbourhood, The Ward, the property at 15 Elm Street contains a 2-storey house-form building completed by 1868 and first owned by Irish-Canadian bricklayer, Robert Kennedy, and family.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>Built in 1868, the property at 15 Elm Street is valued as a remaining example of a Confederation-era house-form building designed in the Georgian Revival style which is evident in its red brick construction, rubble stone foundation and brick, stone and wood detailing. The symmetrically-arranged openings on the upper storey of the principal (north) and east elevations contain masonry sills and segmental-arched brick headers in a solider course pattern.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 1922-1924, a storefront was added at street level with off-set entrance to the existing residential space above. The residential entrance maintains its wood and glass transom and door surround. This resulting mixed use type of house-form buildings is considered a defining feature of the south side of Elm Street today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Historical and Associative Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property is significant as one of the earliest (Confederation-era) surviving house-form buildings constructed on the south side of Elm Street between Yonge and Bay streets in 1868. Since the mid-19th century, Elm Street has continued to provide an understanding of the built form of Toronto's first immigrant neighbourhood, The Ward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 15 Elm Street, embodies part of a significant collection of 19th-century house-form buildings representative of this early period of land development on the block of Elm Street between Yonge and Bay streets within the city's historically significant St. John's Ward (\"The Ward\"), and part of the collection of diverse 19th-century building types and uses that have contributed to the unique quality of Elm Street today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Within the context of a neighbourhood originally developed with mainly residential properties in the mid-to-late 19th century, and on the south side of Elm Street between Yonge and Bay where numerous properties of similar type, scale, placement and setback are already recognized on the City's Heritage Register, the subject property at 15 Elm Street is valued for its historic, physical and visual links to its surroundings for more than 150 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the property at 15 Elm Street as representative of a Confederation-era house-form building designed in the Georgian Revival style include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scale, form and massing of the red brick house-form building with its two-storey rectangular plan</li>\n<li>The rubble stone foundation</li>\n<li>The gable roof and two red brick chimneys located north and south of the gable peak at its western edge</li>\n<li>The principal (north) elevation of the building, which is organized into two bays</li>\n<li>The segmental-arched window openings on the upper storey of the principal (north) and east elevations, with their brick header detailing and masonry sills</li>\n<li>The early 1920s wood and glass transom and door surround at the east end of the principal (north) elevation and leading to the upper storey space&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The early 1920s stringcourse directly above the early storefront and off-set residential entrance on the principal (north) elevation (currently over-clad with wooden boards)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the contextual value of 15 Elm Street as defining and supporting the character of this portion of Elm Street, and as being historically and visually linked to its surroundings include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The setback, placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the south side of Elm Street between Yonge Street and Bay Street, and directly adjacent to Harry Barberian Lane to the east and south of the property</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Administrator, Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:hertpb@toronto.ca\">hertpb@toronto.ca</a> within thirty days of May 16, 2023, which is June 15, 2023.
