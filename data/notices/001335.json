  "noticeDescription": "<p>Notice is hereby given that City officials are recommending to Toronto City Council the enactment of a by-law, effective January 1, 2020, amending the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, and any other necessary Municipal Code Chapters as may be required, to:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers; <br />-&nbsp; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees; <br />As shown in Appendix A https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-139949.pdf, the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective January 1, 2020, are as follows:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp; for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate &nbsp;and the Block 2 Rate by 3.0%; and<br />-&nbsp; for flat rate consumers, all rates by 3.0%.<br />&nbsp;The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2020, are shown in Appendix B http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-139950.pdf</p>\n<p>City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.</p>\n<p>The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and the General Manager, Toronto Water entitled \"2020 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees \" (the \"Report\").</p>\n<p>The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2020 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.390 billion, which is fully funded from the 2020 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services.</p>\n<p>The Budget Committee will hear public deputations from any person, or their counsel, agent or solicitor, who wishes to speak to the matter at the meeting.</p>\n<p>To make a presentation at the Budget Committee meeting on November 25, 2019, please email buc@toronto.ca or call 416-392-4666 no later than 12:00 p.m., November 22, 2019,.
