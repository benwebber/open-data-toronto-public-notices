The City is recommending updates and additions to Schedule 3: Application Requirements and Section 3.1.6, Heritage Conservation. The purpose of amendments to Schedule 3: Application Requirements is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>clarify the intent of the Official Plan by updating, streamlining, consolidating or separating existing application requirements;</li>\n<li>reflect new requirements due to changes in legislation or policy;</li>\n<li>ensure consistency with the City&rsquo;s Application Support Material: Terms of Reference; and</li>\n<li>support the City's ability to meet legislated timelines for decision-making and approval.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The purpose of amendments to Section 3.1.6 of the Official Plan are to add a policy to support the addition of a Cultural Heritage Evaluation Report requirement in Schedule 3: Application Requirements. The Cultural Heritage Evaluation Report requirement:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>supports the identification of properties with cultural heritage value as early as possible in a development application process;</li>\n<li>provides opportunity for community input in identifying cultural heritage value;</li>\n<li>provides opportunity for dialogue and efficiencies when advancing designation and understanding of cultural heritage value; and</li>\n<li>supports the City's ability to meet legislated timelines for decision-making and approval.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The recommended OPA 720 will assist the City in implementing Official Plan policy through the development review process. OPA 720 is consistent with, conforms to and does not conflict with the Provincial Policy Statement and Growth Plan (2020).</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Michelle Drylie, Project Director at 416-392-3436, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca\">Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A copy of City Planning's Final Report on the proposed Official Plan Amendment will be available on the City's website at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html\">www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the Official Plan Amendment.
