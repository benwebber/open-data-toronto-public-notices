The current <em>Avenues</em> policy framework has helped manage growth on <em>Avenues</em> for over two decades.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Housing Action Plan (HAP) required a review of the <em>Avenues</em> policy framework to assess opportunities for enabling more housing and sustainable, complete communities. The review included updating the vision and policies for <em>Avenues</em>, expanding and introducing new <em>Avenues</em>, streamlining study requirements, consideration of opportunities for areas of transition between <em>Avenues</em> and <em>Neighbourhoods</em>, and public and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The purpose of the recommended Official Plan Amendment (OPA) 778 that resulted from the review is to provide a new policy framework for <em>Avenues</em>. The recommended OPA 778 replaces the <em>Avenues</em> policies in Section 2.2.3 with new policies and introduces mapping changes to Map 2 (Urban Structure) by adding 283 kilometres of new <em>Avenues</em>. The new policies address built form and the activation of the ground floor of new developments along <em>Avenues</em>; removes the requirement for Avenues Segment Reviews as part of a complete application; removes city-initiated Avenues Studies; and provides policy direction on consultation with the local community, existing businesses, and community service providers when development results in the displacement of businesses and community service providers along <em>Avenues</em>. The OPA also introduces a monitoring program to assess the implementation of the new <em>Avenues</em> policy framework. The OPA does not change any land use designations in the Official Plan. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recommended Official Plan Amendment is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement, 2024, specifically supporting the achievement of complete communities; encouraging transit-supportive development and intensification in proximity to transit, including corridors and stations; and identifying the appropriate type and scale of development in strategic growth areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>OPA 778 has been informed by public and stakeholder engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment will be available starting on January 3, 2025, at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/HAPAvenues\">www.toronto.ca/HAPAvenues</a>. &nbsp;You may also obtain this material by contacting Kyle Pakeman, Project Coordinator at</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Kyle.Pakeman@toronto.ca\">Kyle.Pakeman@toronto.ca</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF OPEN HOUSE</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are invited to attend the Open House to review and ask questions about the proposed Official Plan Amendment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the amendment.
