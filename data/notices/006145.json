The holding of public hearings on the Official Plan Amendment may be delegated by Council to the Planning and Housing Committee under Section 24 of the <em>City of Toronto Act</em>, 2006 and the <em>Toronto Municipal Code.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Toronto&rsquo;s Official Plan contains policies that identify uses that are permitted in <em>Core Employment Areas</em> and <em>General Employment Areas</em>, which are places for business and economic activities. On June 8, 2023, Bill 97 (<em>Helping Homebuyers, Protecting Tenants Act, 2023</em>) received Royal Assent. Bill 97 amended the<em> Planning</em> Act definition for an &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo; by narrowing the scope of what uses can comprise an &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo; by expressly excluding all types of institutional uses and most types of commercial uses. Bill 97 also introduced a transition provision that allows municipalities to put in place Official Plan policies that would authorize the continuation of &ldquo;lawfully established&rdquo; uses in an area of employment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed Official Plan Amendment amends the City&rsquo;s Official Plan policies and mapping to ensure conformity with the <em>Planning</em> Act, as amended, and consistency with the PPS 2024, and provides for transitional permissions in accordance with Bill 97.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information, including a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment (starting on April 16, 2025) may be obtained by contacting Kyle Pakeman, Project Coordinator, at 416-392-6477 or by eâ€‘mail at <a href=\"mailto:Kyle.Pakeman@toronto.ca\">Kyle.Pakeman@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information, including a draft of the OPA, is also available on April 16, 2025 at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/Bill97AoE\">www.toronto.ca/Bill97AoE</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A copy of City Planning's Final Report on the proposed Official Plan Amendment, will be available on the City's website approximately one week prior to the Special Public Meeting at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html\">www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF OPEN HOUSE</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You are invited to attend the Open House(s) to review the proposed Official Plan Amendment and to ask questions about the proposed policies and any related information and material.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF SPECIAL PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the Official Plan Amendment.
