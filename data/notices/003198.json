Built c. 1886, the 2-storey brick-clad building displays decorative original architectural detailing including a deep wooden cornice with ornate large corner bracket and upper-storey window openings framed with heavy stone lintels affixed with yoke-patterned wooden plates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Historical and Associative Value</strong></p>\n<p>The subject property is valued for its ability to yield information that contributes to our understanding of the development of various historic settlements near the GTR tracks at the corner of Danforth Avenue and Dawes Road from the mid-nineteenth to early-twentieth centuries. First the location of Dawes' Corners in 1850, followed by Smith's Corner in 1870, and Little York and Coleman's Corner from the 1880s until the annexation of Little York to the Town of East Toronto in 1903, this intersection was a popular location for local inns and stores to serve the residential and commercial needs of market-bound farmers along Dawes Road, as well as a burgeoning local population.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>Contextually, the property has cultural heritage value as it maintains and supports the late-19th century main street commercial built form evolution and historic character of the Danforth and Dawes intersection in particular, and Danforth Avenue in general.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 2734 Danforth Avenue (along with the rest of the row constructed together at 2736-2740) is visually, physically and historically linked to its surroundings as part of a surviving collection of fine-grained, mixed-use main street commercial and residential row buildings that have developed from discreet pockets clustered around individual rural villages like Little York, to defining the Danforth streetscape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design or Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the property at 2734 Danforth Avenue being a representative example of the late-19th century main street commercial row typology:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of Danforth Avenue, west of Dawes Road</li>\n<li>The scale, form and massing of the 2-storey building on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</li>\n<li>The materials, with the red brick cladding with stone and wood detailing</li>\n<li>The deep wooden cornice below the roofline with its ornately-carved large wooden corner bracket at the west end</li>\n<li>The principal (south) elevation, which is organized into two symmetrical bays at the second storey level, and commercial storefront ground level</li>\n<li>The symmetrical arrangement of the two flat-headed window openings on the second storey of the principal (south) elevation surmounted by large stone lintels with a decorative yoke-pattern wooden plate affixed atop each</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the property as supporting the historic character of the East End-Danforth neighbourhood:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scale, form and massing of the 2-storey building on a rectangular plan with a flat roof</li>\n<li>The materials, with the red brick cladding with stone and wood detailing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the property as being visually, physically and historically linked to the Danforth and Dawes intersection as part of a surviving collection of fine-grained, mixed-use main street commercial and residential row buildings that continue to define the Danforth streetscape today:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The setback, placement and orientation of the building on the north side of Danforth Avenue, west of Dawes Road</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Administrator, Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: hertpb@toronto.ca within thirty days of April 11, 2022, which is May 11, 2022.
