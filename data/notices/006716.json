Constructed circa 1890, the property contains a detached two-and-a-half storey house form building designed in the Annex architectural style.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties were included on the Heritage Register in June 1973.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 512 Jarvis Street has design and physical value as it displays a high degree of artistic merit and is a representative example of the Annex architectural style as applied to a detached house form structure. The Annex architectural style was popular in Toronto from the 1880s up to 1900. The origins of the architectural style are often attributed to the architect E. J. Lennox, however it was employed by numerous practitioners, and was primarily if not exclusively applied to residential house form structures. The Annex architectural style combined elements of the Romanesque and Queen Anne architectural styles. Architectural features representative of the Annex architectural style, and that display a high degree of artistic merit, include the brick cladding with brick and sandstone detailing; the deep eaves with exposed beams; the central front gable dormer with four smaller inset windows; and the window openings of varying sizes and scales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 512 Jarvis Street is visually, functionally, and historically linked to the adjacent properties at 504, 506, 510 and 514 Jarvis Street, which collectively form a collection of 19th century housing occupying the full block frontage of Jarvis Street between Cawthra Square and Gloucester Street. Each property contains a detached house form structure designed in the Annex architectural style, with a generally consistent setback, scale, form and massing, although 512 and 514 Jarvis Street are slightly smaller than the southern houses. Visually, the subject property is linked to these adjacent properties as well as nearby house form buildings representative of the historic residential context of Upper Jarvis from the late 19th century and is situated in an area with a concentration of properties built during the mid- to late Victorian period and that have been designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 512 Jarvis Street is important in maintaining and supporting the character of the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood and the Cawthra Square - Jarvis Street - Gloucester Street block frontage, comprised of a collection of 19th century house form buildings. Subsequent mid- to late- 20th century apartment buildings reflect the second wave of residential development that replaced many of the original house form buildings akin to the subject property. Collectively, these properties reflect the evolution of Upper Jarvis from a subdivision of private homes located on a landscaped avenue to a high-density residential and institutional arterial corridor within downtown Toronto</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the cultural heritage value of the properties at 512 Jarvis Street being a representative example of a detached house form designed in the Annex architectural style:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The scale, form and massing of the subject property, containing a detached two-and-a-half storey house form building set-back from the sidewalk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The red brick and sandstone cladding and ornamentation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The round-arched and flat-headed window openings with stone sills, brick lintels and drip moulds</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The prominent gabled dormer window containing four windows set beneath a large pedimented gable and with dentil detailing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The prominent roof comprised of a high-pitched hipped roof with cross-gable and shed dormer windows deep eaves with exposed rafter beams and punctuated by brick chimneys</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The flat-headed and round-arched window openings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The front porch on the primary (east) facade, with wooden columns atop brick piers</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The primary (east) entrance set within a round-arched opening and with a fanlight transom window</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the cultural heritage value of the property at 512 Jarvis Street being visually, functionally and historically linked to its surroundings and for maintaining and supporting the character of the area:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The placement, setback and orientation of the structure on the west side of Jarvis Street between Cawthra Square and Gloucester Street</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The two-and-a-half storey scale of the primary (east) fa&ccedil;ade</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The wrought iron fence dividing the front yard from the sidewalk</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Registrar Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca\">RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca</a> within thirty (30) days of October 10, 2025, which is November 10, 2025.
