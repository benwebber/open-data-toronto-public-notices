The property straddles the eastern boundary of the Old Town of York, the historic St. Lawrence neighbourhood and Heritage Conservation District (HCD) to the south, the Garden District HCD to the north and Corktown to the east. Built in 1881, the Late Victorian era property contains a semi-detached house-form building representing the Bay-and-Gable type with Gothic Revival styling. A gabled, 2-storey rear wing has been over-clad with stucco. Adjoining this wing is a 1980s one-storey addition containing an enclosed rear entrance to both 111 Berkeley Street and the neighbouring property at 115 Berkeley.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2.5 storey, semi-detached house-form building at 111 Berkeley Street is valued as a fine example of the Bay-and-Gable typology. The mirrored organization of the principal (west) elevations with their raised main entrances on the inner bay and single-storey gable in the outer bay are characteristic of the type. Built in 1881, the property contains well-executed defining features of Gothic Revival styling including the steeply-pitched roof gables containing attic windows and decorative wooden bargeboards, the dichromatic brickwork, and double singlet openings on the second storey on the principal (west) elevation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 111 Berkeley Street is valued for its historic association with Berkeley Street as the original eastern boundary of the ten-block Town of York established in 1793, and for its association with the history and development of the broader King-Parliament area during its Urban &amp; Industrial Expansion (1850-1914) period of significance, as an urban townscape combining industrial, commercial and residential functions.</p>\n<p>The property contributes to the historic character of the immediate and broader physical context of the street and the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the property at 111 Berkeley Street, along with the adjacent semi-detached house-form building at 115 Berkeley Street, is valued for its role in defining, supporting and maintaining the historical character of the King Parliament neighbourhood which contains the historic 1793 Town of York with Berkeley Street defining its eastern boundary, and reflecting the area's evolution from a 19th-century residential and institutional enclave and one of Toronto&rsquo;s manufacturing centres in the first half of the 20th century, to its current status as a mixed-use community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 111 Berkeley Street is also historically, visually and physically linked to its setting in the King-Parliament community where, along with the adjacent semi-detached house-form building at 115 Berkeley Street, it stands among a significant collection of surviving mid to late-19th century residential buildings along both sides of Berkeley Street between King and Richmond, including the Charles Coxwell Small House at 300 King Street E (1845), 55-79 Berkeley (1872), 72-78 Berkeley (1883), and 106-112 Berkeley (1886), all of which are recognized on the City's Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design or Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the property at 111 Berkeley Street as a fine example of the Bay-and-Gable typology with Gothic Revival styling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the 2.5-storey, rectangular form, scale and massing of the semi-detached house-form building with a raised basement on a stone foundation</li>\n<li>the roofline, with a steeply pitched gabled roof and two cross roof gables (one on either end of the principal west elevation)</li>\n<li>the asymmetrical 2-bay division of the mirrored halves with the raised main entrances on the inner bays and single-storey gables on the outer bays</li>\n<li>the red brick cladding with buff brick detailing on the principal (west) elevation, including the quoining, label mouldings and headers, double string courses at the top of the first and second storeys, single string course in the attic storey and the belt course above the raised basement</li>\n<li>the type and arrangement of the window openings on the outer bays: the flat headed openings in the three-sided projecting bay with two segmental-arched singlets at the second storey and small round-arched opening in the attic storey&nbsp;</li>\n<li>the type and arrangement of the window openings on the inner bays: the segmental-arched doorway at the first storey surmounted by a segmental-arched, rectangular window opening</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the contextual value of the property at 111 Berkeley Street as helping to define, maintain and support the historic mid-to-late 19th century residential character of Berkeley Street between King and Richmond:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the placement and orientation of the building on its lot on the east side of Berkeley Street and adjacent to the property at 115 Berkeley Street with similar setback from the street as the other historic houses on the block</li>\n<li>the Bay-and-Gable typology and materiality with the dichromatic brickwork also employed on adjacent historic house-form buildings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>N.B. the rear wing at the subject property is not considered a heritage attribute</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Registrar Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca\">RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca </a><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">within thirty (30) days of April 23, 2024, which is May 23, 2024.
