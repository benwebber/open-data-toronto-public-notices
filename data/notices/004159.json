  "noticeDescription": "<p><strong>Location of Application: City-wide </strong><br /><strong>Applicant: City of Toronto (City Initiated)</strong><br /><br /><strong>DATE: July 5, 2023</strong><br /><strong>TIME: 9:30 a.m. or as soon as possible thereafter</strong><br /><strong>PLACE: Committee Room 1, City Hall, 100 Queen Street West and by Video Conference</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL - PURPOSE AND EFFECT</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The City of Toronto is proposing a City-Initiated Official Plan Amendment to support implementation of Bill 109, <em>More Homes for Everyone Act</em>,<em> 2022</em>. The<em> Planning Act</em> provides tools to help municipalities implement their Official Plans. Bill 13, the <em>Supporting People and Businesses Act, 2021,</em> introduced a new section 39.2 to the <em>Planning Act,</em> enabling municipal councils to, by by-law, delegate the authority to pass zoning by-laws that are of a minor nature to a committee of Council or an individual who is an officer, employee or agent of the municipality. The <em>Planning Act</em> requires a municipality's Official Plan to include policies that specify the types of minor by-laws that may be delegated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chapter 5 of the Official Plan outlines a variety of tools that the City can use to implement the Plan's objectives. Section 5.1 includes policy tools available to municipalities under the Planning Act for managing growth and change. Recommended OPA 660 introduces two new policies to section 5.1 to address delegated authority for minor zoning by-laws and alternative measures for informing and obtaining the views of the public. OPA 660 specifies three minor zoning by-law types that may be delegated, including: Removal of a Holding (&ldquo;H&rdquo;) Symbol, Temporary Use by-law and by-laws to enact housekeeping/technical amendments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An associated Municipal By-law Amendment is being made to Chapter 415 of the Toronto Municipal Code to delegate authority for removal of a Holding (&ldquo;H&rdquo;) Symbol only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Michelle Drylie, Project Director at 416-392-3436, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca\">Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A copy of City Planning's Final Report on the proposed Official Plan Amendment and associated Municipal Code Amendment will be available on the City's website at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html\">www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the Official Plan Amendment.
