Phase 1 focuses on addressing policy conflicts between the Official Plan and the PPS 2024, while Phase 2 will focus on ensuring that the Official Plan aligns with and supports the objectives of the PPS 2024.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through Phase 1, the City has identified six areas of policy conflict that are proposed to be addressed through an Official Plan Amendment:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Population and Employment Growth Forecasting</li>\n<li>Provincial Mobility Hubs</li>\n<li>References to Urban Growth Centres</li>\n<li>References to former Provincial Plans and associated terms and definitions</li>\n<li>Heritage and Archaeology</li>\n<li>Employment Areas and Land Use Compatibility</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The OPA would amend the following sections and maps in the Official Plan:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Table of Contents, Official Plan: List of Maps</li>\n<li>Chapter 2, Section 2.1 Building a More Liveable Urban Region</li>\n<li>Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 Downtown: The Heart of Toronto</li>\n<li>Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2 Centres: Vital Mixed Communities</li>\n<li>Chapter 2, Section 2.2.4 Employment Areas: Supporting Business and Employment Growth</li>\n<li>Chapter 3, Section 3.1.6 Heritage Conservation</li>\n<li>Chapter 3, Section 3.4 The Natural Environment</li>\n<li>Chapter 4, Section 4.6 Employment Areas</li>\n<li>Chapter 6, Secondary Plans 8, 10, 17, 18, 21, 41 &amp; 42</li>\n<li>Chapter 7, Site and Area Specific Policies 29, 395 and 426</li>\n<li>Map 6: Downtown Toronto Urban Growth Centre</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <em>Planning Act</em> requires that if an Official Plan is being revised under Section 26 of the <em>Act</em>, a Special Public Meeting must be held on any proposed amendments to revise the Official Plan and that an Open House be held to ensure that the public has an opportunity to review and ask questions about the information and material made available in advance of the Special Public Meeting. The holding of public hearings on the Official Plan Amendment may be delegated by Council to the Planning and Housing Committee under Section 24 of the <em>City of Toronto Act, 2006</em> and the <em>Toronto Municipal Code</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On August 20, 2024, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing released the final version of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ontario.ca/page/provincial-planning-statement-2024\">https://www.ontario.ca/page/provincial-planning-statement-2024</a>&nbsp;(PPS 2024). The PPS 2024 came into effect on October 20, 2024 and replaced the previously issued&nbsp;Provincial Policy Statement 2020&nbsp;and Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PPS 2024 is a consolidated statement of the Province&rsquo;s policies on land use planning. With the PPS 2024, a number of policy changes were made that effect how the City can manage growth and plan for complete communities. In particular, the PPS 2024 made changes that have implications for how the City can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Forecast population and employment growth</li>\n<li>Plan and protect employment areas</li>\n<li>Address land use compatibility issues between industrial uses and residential areas, and</li>\n<li>The protection and preservation of cultural heritage resources.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As required by the&nbsp;<em>Planning Act,</em> the City&nbsp;is undertaking a review of the Official Plan and will bring forward Official Plan Amendments for Council&rsquo;s consideration to ensure that the Official Plan is consistent with the PPS 2024.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On June 24, 2025, the City held a public meeting to introduce proposed changes to the Official Plan identified through Phase 1 of the exercise.
