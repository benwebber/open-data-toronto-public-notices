The changes help clarify implementation issues identified through the first year review of the Multi-Tenant House Regulatory Framework. The changes simplify the administration of the zoning permissions and reinforce the intent of the Council-adopted framework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed zoning by-law amendments will amend the definition of &ldquo;multi-tenant house&rdquo; to use the term &ldquo;premises&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;building&rdquo; and apply associated regulations to the &ldquo;lot&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;building&rdquo;. These amendments clarify and simplify administration of the multi-tenant house regulations in situations where a single building straddles multiple lots, such as a townhouse, or where certain rental arrangements in an apartment building could cause the entire building to be classified as a multi-tenant house despite not operating as such.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed amendments will also introduce regulations providing implementation guidance identifying which zoning performance standards apply when all or part of an existing residential building is converted to a multi-tenant house, and to standalone multi-tenant houses that do not contain any dwelling units.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amendments will also update the zoning by-law&rsquo;s accessible parking space provisions to include a rate for dwelling rooms in a multi-tenant house, as this rate was unintentionally omitted during general updates to accessible parking regulations through By-law 223-2025.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting John Duncan, Senior Planner Policy and Research, at 416-392-1530, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:John.Duncan@toronto.ca\">John.Duncan@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information on the City&rsquo;s Multi-Tenant Houses Regulatory Framework can be found at <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/MultiTenantHouses\">https://www.toronto.ca/MultiTenantHouses</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the application.
