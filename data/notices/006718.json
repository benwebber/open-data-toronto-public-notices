The property contains a 1949 limestone-clad one-storey bank building fronting onto Weston Road with stucco clad rear wing, and 1981-82 one-storey stucco-clad addition extension to the south.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1151 Weston Road has design and physical value as a representative example of a post World War II branch bank building. Unlike earlier branch banks, which dominated their surroundings as a means of expressing their importance, post-War branch banks were frequently understated. Emphasizing openness and accessibility, their designs reflected the changing role of banks, which offered a wider range of products and services to a more diverse clientele. Often single storied, their designs combined the simplicity of form and clean lines of the Modernist Style with traditional materials such as brick and stone and Classical elements. This is evidenced in the property's low rectangular massing with flat roof, large window openings and front entrance framed in stainless steel, asymmetrical principal elevation, and limestone cladding, cornice and bas-relief carved panels. In October 1950, the property was one of the fourteen branch banks in Canada selected by the Journal of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada representing the social and architectural changes after the Second World War.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property also has design value for its high degree of craftsmanship and artistic merit. This is evidenced in the building's balance of Modernist and Classical elements including extensive window glazing and entrance vestibule framed in stainless steel, limestone cladding, and finely executed bas relief carved stone panels.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Historical and Associative Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1151 Weston Road has value for its association with the Bank of Nova Scotia, which has served the Mount Dennis community since 1913 and has continuously operated from the property since its construction in 1949.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property also has historical value for its contribution to an understanding of the historical development and evolution of Mount Dennis as an independent community where the property, like many bank buildings, occupies a prominent location at the centre of the community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 1151 Weston Road has further value for its association with important Canadian architect Gordon S. Adamson (1904-1986), who is credited with advancing Canadian modernism after World War II. Important modernist achievements by Adamson and his firm, Gordon S. Adamson and Associates, include the Part IV designated William Wrigley Jr. Company Headquarters (1962) at 1123 Leslie Street; the Massey Medal award winning Savoy Plaza Apartments (1951) at 130 Old Forest Hill Road and Kipling Collegiate Institute (1961) at 130 The Westway; the critically acclaimed E.J. Pratt Library (1960) and Edward Johnson Building (1961-63) at the University of Toronto; and the Redpath Sugar Refinery (1957) at 95 Queens Quay East and Defence Research Medical Laboratories (1956) at 1133 Sheppard Avenue West, which are included on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 1151 Weston Road is important in defining, supporting, and maintaining the small-town commercial main street character of Weston Road between Eglinton Avenue West and Oxford Avenue, which forms the centre of Mount Dennis' downtown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Constructed for the Bank of Nova Scotia at the centre of the commercial area of Mount Dennis, the property at 1151 Weston Road is functionally and historically linked to its surroundings. Prominently located at the northeast corner of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue West, the property has served as a local landmark since its construction in 1949.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design or Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the design and physical value of the</p>\n<p>Property:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The scale, form, and massing of the structure, with its rectangular plan, one-storey height, and flat roof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ashlar faced limestone cladding, parapet, and overhanging cornice featuring raked white mortar joints</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The symmetrically placed fenestration on the north elevation with window lights featuring stainless-steel frames with muntin and mullions featuring decorative square plates at their intersections</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The asymmetrically placed fenestration on the principal (west) elevation with window lights featuring stainless-steel frames with muntin and mullions featuring decorative square plates at their intersections and an offset glass and stainless-steel double entrance with vestibule and projecting roof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The principal (west) elevation's three carved limestone bas relief panels featuring the emblems from the Bank of Nova Scotia&rsquo;s Coat of Arms: the Bluenose Schooner, the codfish, and the wheat and plow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The orientation of the structure at the northeast corner of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue West with the principal (west) elevation set parallel to Weston Road&nbsp;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Historical and Associative Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the historical and associative value of the</p>\n<p>Property:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The three carved limestone bas relief panels featuring the emblems from the Bank of Nova Scotia&rsquo;s Coat of Arms: the Bluenose Schooner, the codfish, and the wheat and plow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The location of the structure at the northeast corner of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue West with the principal (west) elevation with entrance facing Weston Road</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the contextual value of the</p>\n<p>Property:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The scale, form, and massing of the structure with its rectangular plan, one-storey height, and flat roof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ashlar faced limestone cladding, parapet, and overhanging cornice featuring raked white mortar joints</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The asymmetrically placed fenestration on the principal (west) elevation with window lights featuring stainless-steel frames with muntin and mullions featuring decorative square plates at their intersections and an offset glass and stainless-steel double entrance with vestibule and projecting roof</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The principal (west) elevation's three carved limestone bas relief panels featuring the emblems from the Bank of Nova Scotia&rsquo;s Coat of Arms: the Bluenose Schooner, the codfish, and the wheat and plow</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The orientation of the structure with the principal (west) elevation fronting onto Weston Road.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>NOTE: The rear wing of the 1949 building and the 1981-82 extension to the south are not considered heritage attributes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Registrar Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca\">RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca</a> within thirty (30) days of October 10, 2025, which is November 10, 2025.
