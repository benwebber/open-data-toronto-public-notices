Robins and designed by Toronto architect, George R. Harper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It anchors the south end of the intact group of five commercial buildings at 710-718 Yonge Street that, following their identification as &ldquo;contributing heritage properties&rdquo; in the Historic Yonge Street Heritage Conservation District (HCD) Plan, were listed on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register in 2016.&nbsp; The northernmost unit of the group at 718 Yonge Street was individually designated under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act in October 2017 by By-law 1026-2017.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The property at 710 Yonge Street is valued for the design of the building as a representative example of a &ldquo;Main Street Row&rdquo; identified by the two-storey scale, the glazed storefront with residential or commercial units in the upper floor, and the Edwardian Classical styling popular for early 20th-century commercial structures.
