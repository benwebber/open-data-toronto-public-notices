This proposal is part of the Housing Action Plan&rsquo;s Avenue, Mid-rise and Mixed Use Areas initiative.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed zoning by-law amendments will introduce additional Development Standard Sets for the Commercial Residential (CR) Zone with standards that control how mid-rise buildings transition towards neighbouring buildings and open spaces using specified setbacks rather than a rear angular plane. The new Development Standard Sets will be applied to properties that are located within Mixed Use Areas-designated portions of Avenues in the Official Plan, are currently zoned CR, are currently subject to Development Standard Sets SS2 or SS3, are not within a regulated flood plain, and are not subject to a Site Specific Exception with potentially conflicting setback regulations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed amendments will also update the maximum height permissions for these properties on the Article 995.20.1 Height Overlay Map to correspond to the width of the right-of-way onto which they front, in keeping with the direction of the Official Plan and Urban Design Guidelines for mid-rise building heights. The amendments will also update the permitted maximum floor space index for these properties to reflect the building envelope established by the updated development standards and height permissions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amendments will also introduce a regulation that would apply to all zones, providing implementation guidance for how zoning standards are superseded or applied in the event of inconsistencies between zoning standards and requirements secured in a heritage permit issued under the Ontario Heritage Act, as well as updated definitions relating to heritage properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting John Duncan, Senior Planner Policy and Research at 416-392-1530, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:John.Duncan@toronto.ca\">John.Duncan@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information on this proposal and the Housing Action Plan&rsquo;s Avenues, Mid-rise and Mixed Use Areas study can be found at <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/HAPAvenues\">https://www.toronto.ca/HAPAvenues</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the proposed Zoning By-law Amendments.&nbsp; These recommendations will then be forwarded to Toronto City Council for its consideration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can follow the meeting at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive\">www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>MAKE YOUR VIEWS KNOWN</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may send written comments by e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:phc@toronto.ca\">phc@toronto.ca</a> or by mail to the address below.
