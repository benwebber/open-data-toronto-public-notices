  "noticeDescription": "<p>Notice is hereby given that City officials are recommending to Toronto City Council the enactment of a by-law, effective April 1, 2019, amending the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, and any other necessary Municipal Code Chapters as may be required, to:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers;</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees; and,</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; to establish a new bulk water fee, based on the Block 1 Rate, for the supply and delivery of water at a City-owned and operated bulk water fill station.</p>\n<p>As shown in Appendix A, available at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123889.pdf\">http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123889.pdf</a>, the recommended increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective April 1, 2019, are as follows:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate&nbsp; and the Block 2 Rate by 3.98%; and</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; for flat rate consumers, all rates by 3.98%.</p>\n<p>The proposed increases to water and wastewater service fees, as well as the recommended new bulk water fee, effective April 1, 2019, are shown in Appendix B, available at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123890.pdf\">http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2019/bu/bgrd/backgroundfile-123890.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.</p>\n<p>The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, as well as the proposed new bulk water fee, are set out in the report to the Budget Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer &amp; Treasurer and the Acting General Manager, Toronto Water entitled \"2019 Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees \" (the \"Report\").</p>\n<p>The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructure to deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario.&nbsp; The Toronto Water 2019 Operating and Capital Budget requires a combined water and wastewater expenditure level of $1.331 billion, which is fully funded from the 2019 water and wastewater consumption rates and service fees. The proposed water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that the appropriate funding is available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services. The recommended new bulk water fee reflects the cost of providing that service.</p>\n<p>The Budget Committee has established two subcommittees to hear public deputations on the 2019 Capital and Operating Budgets. The Budget Subcommittee for City Hall, and North York Civic Centre Consultation and the Budget Subcommittee for Scarborough Civic Centre and Etobicoke Civic Centre Consultation will receive presentations from any person, or their counsel, agent or solicitor, who wishes to speak to the matter at one of the following meetings:</p>\n<p><strong>- City Hall, Committee Room 1, 100 Queen Street West</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>February 7, 2019</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 1 - 9:30 a.m.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 2 - 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>- Scarborough Civic Centre, Council Chamber, 150 Borough Drive</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>February 7, 2019</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 1 - 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 2 - 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>- Etobicoke Civic Centre, Council Chamber, 399 The West Mall</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>February 11, 2019</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 1 &ndash; 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 2 &ndash; 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>- North York Civic Centre, Council Chamber, 5100 Yonge Street</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>February 11, 2019</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 1 &ndash; 3:00 p.m.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Session 2 &ndash; 6:00 p.m.</p>\n<p>To make a presentation at one of the Budget Subcommittee meetings on February 7 or 11, 2019, please email <a href=\"mailto:buc@toronto.ca\">buc@toronto.ca</a> or call 416-392-4666 no later than 12:00 p.m. February 6, 2019.
