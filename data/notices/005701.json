These proposals form part of the City of Toronto's Expanding Housing Opportunities in Neighbourhoods (EHON) work program, through the Neighbourhood Retail and Services study.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The City-initiated Zoning By-law Amendment to expand commercial use permissions applies to all zones under the Residential Zone Category including the R &ndash; Residential Zone, RD &ndash; Residential Detached, RS &ndash; Residential Semi-Detached, RT &ndash; Residential Townhouse, and RM&ndash; Residential Multiple Zone.&nbsp; The Amendment would allow a broad range of retail, service and office uses on all Residentially zoned sites located on Major Streets.&nbsp; In the interior of the neighbourhoods, the location of commercial uses would be limited to corner sites, as well as sites adjacent to existing non-residential uses, such as schools and parks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Amendment sets maximum interior floor areas for the commercial uses in all locations as well as other performance standards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The City-initiated Zoning By-law Amendment to expand permissions for home occupations applies to all zones where home occupations are permitted. The Amendment would allow a limited number of clients and employees to attend a home occupation, and allow home occupations to occur in an ancillary building, including music or dance instruction. The majority of the current Use Specific Regulations for Home Occupations remain unchanged.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting Michael Noble, Project Manager, at 416-894-4363, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Michael.Noble@toronto.ca\">Michael.Noble@toronto.ca</a>.
