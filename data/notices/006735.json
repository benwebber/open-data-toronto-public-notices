The recommended amendments are technical in nature and do not affect the substance of the by-law.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These changes may affect the approval of building permits, zoning certificates or other applications for a minor variance, a consent to sever, an amendment to a zoning by-law, an Official Plan amendment or a Minister's zoning order and any appeals of these matters, as well as outstanding appeals of Zoning By-law 569-2013.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information may be obtained by contacting <strong>Michael Hain</strong> at 416-392-8698 or <a href=\"mailto:michael.hain@toronto.ca\">michael.hain@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
