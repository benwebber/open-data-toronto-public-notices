  "noticeDescription": "<p>Notice is given that the Chief Building Official and Executive Director, Toronto Building, is reporting on a proposed amendment to Municipal Code Chapter 694, Signs, General (the \"Sign By-law\"), to amend the Sign By-law to allow for, and regulate, the display of one third party electronic ground sign at the premises municipally known as 2075 Lawrence Avenue East.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed amendment seeks to add an area-specific amendment to the Sign By-law for the premises municipally known as 2075 Lawrence Avenue East to replace the existing regulations for third party signs allowed on the premises, with regulations that would allow and regulate the following third party sign:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">-&nbsp;&nbsp; One third party electronic ground sign containing two sign faces, each facing in an easterly and westerly direction, each containing electronic static copy and each measuring 6.1 metres horizontally by 3.05 metres vertically, with a total sign face area of 18.6 square metres for each sign face; and, a height (highest point of the sign measured from grade) of 10.0 metres.</p>\n<p>The proposed amendment would also modify the permitting regime for 2075 Lawrence Avenue East by including an additional requirement that two existing third party ground signs located at 2075 Lawrence Avenue East, be removed prior to a sign permit being issued for third party signs on the premises, and that applicable sign permit regulations would be also modified by extending the initial permit term from five to ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>The Chief Building Official and Executive Director, Toronto Building, is recommending that the Council of the City of Toronto refuse to add the area-specific amendment to the Sign By-law for 2075 Lawrence Avenue East.</strong></p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee may recommend that the Council of the City of Toronto amend the Sign By-law, to amend Schedule B, Signage Master Plans and Area Specific Amendments, to add a new area specific amendment to Schedule B, Signage Master Plans and Area Specific Amendments, to allow 2075 Lawrence Avenue East to contain, in addition to the signs otherwise permitted, the third party electronic ground sign.</p>\n<p>At its meeting to be held in Toronto City Hall, Committee Room 1, on May 28, 2019 commencing at 10:30 a.m., or as soon as possible thereafter, the Planning and Housing Committee of Toronto City Council will hear in person or by his or her counsel, agent or solicitor, any person who wishes to speak to the matter.</p>\n<p>To obtain or view a copy of the report outlining the proposed amendments, you may view the Planning and Housing Committee <a title=\"Area-Specific Amendment to the Sign Bylaw: 2075 Lawrence Avenue East\" href=\"http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2019.PH6.10\">agenda item PH6.10</a>, as of May 21, 2019.&nbsp;
