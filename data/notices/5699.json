The proposed EDGE Program is a financial incentive program designed to enhance Toronto&rsquo;s competitive edge as a global business centre, while driving sustainable and inclusive growth. It is focused on attracting and retaining employers, increasing high-quality jobs, and stimulating investment across Toronto, while promoting sustainable development and bolstering economic resilience. The CIP focuses on high-growth, export-oriented and visitor-economy sectors that are important to Toronto&rsquo;s economy and workforce, with most sectors typically needing industrial-type spaces. The proposed EDGE program supports new construction or major renovation of buildings in targeted employment sectors through Tax Increment Equivalent Grants, while also including an element for Brownfield Remediation Tax Assistance. The proposed EDGE Program and its enabling CIP addresses the policy considerations, proposed program parameters and recommendations in Item EX11.6 adopted by City Council at its February 6-7, 2024 meeting. The proposed EDGE Program would replace the existing Imagination, Manufacturing, Innovation and Technology (IMIT) program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Given that the Community Improvement Plan listed in this Notice applies to all of the lands within the geographic boundaries of the City of Toronto, a key map has not been provided with this notice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Community Improvement Plan may be obtained by contacting Evan Sinclair, Planner, by phone at 416-338-6279, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Evan.Sinclair@toronto.ca\">Evan.Sinclair@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>A hard copy of the proposed Community Improvement Plan will be available for review at Metro Hall, 22nd floor lobby, 55 John Street, Toronto, Ontario on November 15, 2024.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the proposed Community Improvement Plan.
