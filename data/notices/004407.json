Schedule 3 of the Official Plan conforms to the legislation and includes Site Plan Control application requirements. To better manage legislated application review timelines under Bill 109, the City is recommending a new complete application requirement for Site Plan Control applications. The requirement stipulates in-effect zoning compliance as a complete application requirement for Site Plan Control. This requirement ensures sequential review of Zoning By-law Amendment and Site Plan Control applications against the prescribed timelines for each application type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is the purview of Council to establish the policy and regulatory framework for a given site. Site Plan Control approval implements the approved Official Plan and in-effect Zoning By-law. Under Bill 109, Site Plan Control approval has been delegated to staff. The proposed new requirement supports an order of consideration whereby Council decision-making regarding zoning occurs prior to Site Plan Control approval by staff.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further, this requirement ensures that once the statutory process for obtaining zoning (beyond as-of-right zoning) is complete, including final and binding approval of zoning required to facilitate a development on the property, an owner can proceed to Site Plan Control with certainty. Applicants and City staff should both benefit from this requirement as it significantly minimizes resubmission and additional review of information and materials to support a Site Plan Control application and supports more timely approvals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Michelle Drylie, Project Director at 416-392-3436, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca\">Michelle.Drylie@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A copy of City Planning's Final Report on the proposed Official Plan Amendment will be available on the City's website at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html\">www.toronto.ca/legdocs/agendas.html</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the Official Plan Amendment.
