Update Downsview coordinated the development of the deliverables to advance a shared vision for the lands, including a comprehensive community and stakeholder engagement process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Map 1</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />The purpose of this Official Plan Amendment (716) is to introduce an updated Secondary Plan for the 5.4 square kilometres of lands shown on Map 1 (within Chapter 6 of the City of Toronto Official Plan). The Secondary Plan provides area-specific policies that set out the long-term vision for a complete community with two overall goals: climate resilience and environmental sustainability, and achieving equitable outcomes for Indigenous, Black and equity-deserving communities.&nbsp; The Official Plan Amendment will also amend the City of Toronto Official Plan by updating the appropriate maps to reflect the Secondary Plan outcomes, and will repeal SASPs 68, 596 and 789. Land use changes generally include redesignating lands within the Secondary Plan Area from Regeneration Areas and General Employment Areas to General Employment Areas, Mixed Use Areas, Parks, Other Open Space Areas and Institutional Areas, while maintaining Core Employment Areas, Neighbourhoods and Apartment Neighbourhoods designations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Secondary Plan provides a framework to coordinate development that will occur over the next 30 years. This includes high level direction on the strategic &lsquo;big moves&rsquo;, such as four new major streets, eight new major parks (totaling 14 ha), the creation of other significant public realm elements, rail crossings, a decentralized stormwater management system, community service facilities, minimum amounts of non-residential Gross Floor Area, affordable housing requirements, land uses and maximum densities. The Secondary Plan also identifies 15 Districts where more detailed planning will occur over the course of the development process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Zoning By-law Amendment proposes to rezone the lands shown on Map 2 from Airport Hazard (A) in North York Zoning By-law 7625 to Commercial Residential (CR) in Zoning By-law 569-2013. The Zoning By-law permits a range of educational, employment, entertainment, recreational, community, retail, and arts and cultural uses. It also includes appropriate standards for how the lands can be developed to ensure lower density and temporary or semi-permanent uses, until future permanent development occurs.&nbsp; The Zoning By-law permits a maximum density of 0.15 Floor Space Index and a maximum height of three storeys (12 metres)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Map 2</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material, and a copy of the proposed Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment, may be obtained by contacting Alicia Rinaldi, Assistant Planner, Strategic Initiatives at 416-338-6284, or by e-mail at Alicia.Rinaldi3@toronto.ca. &nbsp;A hard copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment will be available for review at Metro Hall, Downsview Public Library and York Woods Public Library on April 19th.
