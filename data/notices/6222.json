The contiguous properties contain a three-storey commercial brick building constructed in 1909 in the Edwardian Classicism style. The building retains its historic scale, form and massing as a main street commercial row building fronting onto Yonge Street, where it is part of a cohesive grouping of built heritage resources that contribute to a distinct sense of place representing Toronto's late nineteenth to early twentieth century architecture - a period when Yonge Street's main street character was established and flourished.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The property at 756 Yonge Street was included on the Heritage Register in May 2023, and the property at 758 Yonge Street was included on the Heritage Register in March 2016.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p>The properties at 756-758 Yonge Street have design and physical value as a representative example of a main street commercial row building type constructed in 1909 and designed in the Edwardian Classicism architectural style. The use of the Edwardian style is evident in its flat roof with rectangular plan, symmetrical composition with evenly spaced out window bays, each flanked with decorative brickwork including ashlar sill course, brick pilasters, brick quoins, simple projecting brick panels, and the brick parapet that incorporates a simple projecting cornice supported by corbels. The building's low-rise and fine grained built form with storefront at grade is representative of its typology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Situated on the west side of Yonge Street, mid-block between Bloor Street West and Charles Street West, the subject properties maintain and support the historic commercial main street character of Yonge Street, south of Bloor Street, particularly through their connection with the adjacent low-rise properties at 750 and 752 Yonge Street that together form a historic streetwall. The design and material palette of the building are reflective of the predominant architectural styles and features that define historic Yonge Street.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the properties at 756-758 Yonge Street are functionally, visually, and physically linked to Yonge Street, often considered Toronto's \"Main Street,\" as a mixed-use main street commercial row building from the early twentieth century that has consistently provided services, amenities, and employment opportunities to the neighbouring residential areas for over one hundred years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the cultural heritage value of the properties at 756-758 Yonge Street as a representative example of a main street commercial row building designed in the Edwardian Classicism style:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The placement, setback, and orientation of the building on the west side of Yonge Street, mid-block between Bloor Street West and Charles Street West</li>\n<li>The scale, form, and massing of the three-storey building within a rectangular shaped plan</li>\n<li>The flat roofline</li>\n<li>The brick cladding</li>\n<li>The architectural details that are representative of the Edwardian Classicism architectural style, including:</li>\n<li>Simple symmetrical composition with evenly spaced out bays</li>\n<li>Ashlar sill course, and brick pilasters on second and third floors</li>\n<li>Brick quoins on third floor</li>\n<li>Projecting brick panels that delineate the second and third floors</li>\n<li>Brick parapet with projecting cornice supported by evenly spaced corbels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>The following heritage attributes contribute to the cultural heritage value of the properties at 756-758 Yonge Street as supporting and maintaining the historic character of this portion of Yonge Street, and as being functionally, visually, physically, and historically linked to their surroundings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The placement, setback, and orientation of the commercial building on the west side of Yonge Street, mid-block between Charles Street West and Bloor Street West</li>\n<li>The brick cladding on the building's east elevation facing Yonge Street, which is consistent with the brick detailing found in the historic buildings on this portion of Yonge Street</li>\n<li>The scale of the building, which is consistent with the three-storey height and rhythm of narrow storefronts of the adjacent properties, which together form a historic streetwall</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Registrar Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca\">RegistrarCCO@toronto.ca</a> within thirty (30) days of April 28, 2025, which is May 28, 2025.
