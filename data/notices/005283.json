The amendments to the definition narrows the scope of uses that are permitted in these areas. Under the amended definition, manufacturing uses, warehousing uses (including uses related to the movement of goods), and research and development in connection with manufacturing are the primary uses permitted within an &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo;. Retail uses and office uses associated with these primary uses, as well as ancillary facilities, are also permitted within an &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo;. However, commercial uses, including stand-alone retail and stand-alone office uses, and institutional uses (e.g., schools and day cares) have been explicitly excluded as uses permitted within an &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The purpose of proposed Official Plan Amendment 680 is to amend various policies in the Official Plan to bring the plan into conformity with the amended definition of &ldquo;area of employment&rdquo;. To this end, the OPA proposes to alter the land use permissions for the City&rsquo;s General Employment Areas and Core Employment Areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Kyle Pakeman, Project Coordinator at Kyle.Pakeman@toronto.ca, or Rory McNeil, Senior Planner at&nbsp; <a href=\"mailto:Rory.McNeil@toronto.ca\">Rory.McNeil@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The draft Official Plan Amendment is also available starting on June 21, 2024, at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/Bill97AoE\">www.toronto.ca/Bill97AoE</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the amendment.
