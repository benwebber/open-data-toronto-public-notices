The City is also initiating a standalone Zoning By-law to apply the Inclusionary Zoning requirements to lands that are not subject to by-law 569-2013 and are still subject to former municipal zoning by-laws, provided they are located in both an Inclusionary Zoning Market Area and a Minister-approved Protected Major Transit Station Area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recommended amendments were developed to align Toronto&rsquo;s Inclusionary Zoning policy and implementing zoning by-law with recent changes to Provincial requirements, support the delivery of purpose-built rental housing and support a comprehensive approach to ensure Inclusionary Zoning requirements are consistently applied across lands subject to by-law 569-2013 and lands subject to former by-laws.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including the assessment report, background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendment, may be obtained by contacting Christine Ono, Project Manager, City Planning at 416-392-1255, or by e‑mail at <a href=\"mailto:Christine.Ono@toronto.ca\">Christine.Ono@toronto.ca</a>.</strong><strong> Further information is also available at: <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/inclusionary-zoning-policy/\">https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/inclusionary-zoning-policy/</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal, and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the proposed city-initiated Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendments.&nbsp; These recommendations will then be forwarded to Toronto City Council for its consideration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can follow the meeting at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive\">www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>MAKE YOUR VIEWS KNOWN</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may send written comments by e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:phc@toronto.ca\">phc@toronto.ca</a> or by mail to the address below.
