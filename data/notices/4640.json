  "noticeDescription": "<p>Public Notice</p>\n<p><br /><strong>Proposed Amendments to the City of Toronto Municipal Code for Increases to the Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Certain Water and Wastewater Service Fees&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice is hereby given that City officials are recommending to Toronto City Council the enactment of a by-law, effective January 1, 2024, amending the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges, and any other necessary Municipal Code Chapters as may be required, to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>increase the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers;</li>\n<li>increase certain proposed water and wastewater service fees;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As shown in Appendix A (attached), the recommended interim increases in the water and wastewater consumption rates for metered and flat rate consumers, effective January 1, 2024, are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for metered consumers, the Block 1 Rate and the Block 2 Rate by 3 percent; and for flat rate consumers, all rates by 3 percent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The proposed interim increases to water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2024, are shown in Appendix B (attached).</p>\n<p><br />City officials are recommending the adoption of the proposed 2024 interim water and wastewater consumption rates and water and wastewater service fees, effective January 1, 2024, in advance of the 2024 Tax and Rate Supported Operating and Capital Budgets. The recommended interim water and wastewater consumption rates are consistent with the financial modeling and the rate increase requirements presented during the 2023 Budget Process. These interim rates may be amended by City Council when the 2024 Rate supported Operating and Capital Budgets are considered.</p>\n<p><br />City officials are not recommending any other changes to any of the other water and wastewater rates and service fees outlined in the City of Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 441, Fees and Charges.</p>\n<p><br />The particulars of the proposed water and wastewater consumption rates and service fee increases, are set out in the report to the Executive Committee of Toronto City Council from the Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and the General Manager, Toronto Water entitled \"2024 Interim Water and Wastewater Consumption Rates and Service Fees\" (the \"Report\").</p>\n<p><br />The Toronto Water Division of the City of Toronto, which is fully funded from the water and wastewater consumption rates and services fees, provides water and wastewater (WWW) services to the consumers within the City, areas in Peel (wastewater services) and York Region (water services). The City operates an extensive WWW infrastructureto deliver clean water for consumption and to treat wastewater before it is returned to Lake Ontario. The proposed interim water and wastewater consumption rate increases will ensure that funding continues to be available to the City for the continued provision of these water and wastewater services. The proposed water and wastewater service fee increases reflect the increased costs of providing those specific services.</p>\n<p><br />The Executive Committee will hear public deputations from any person, or their counsel, agent or solicitor, who wishes to speak to the matter at the following meeting, to be held in person and via video conference:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Date:</strong> December 5, 2023&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> 9:30 a.m.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Video Conference, or Committee Room 1, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor 100 Queen Street West&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To make a presentation at the Executive Committee meeting on December 5, 2023, please email <a href=\"mailto:exc@toronto.ca\">exc@toronto.ca</a> or call 416-392-7033 no later than 12:00 p.m., December 4, 2023.
