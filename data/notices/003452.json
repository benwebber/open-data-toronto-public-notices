  "noticeDescription": "<p>TAKE NOTICE that Council for the City of Toronto intends to designate the property, including the lands, buildings and structures thereon known municipally as 49-59 Huntley Street under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.O.18, as amended, as a property of cultural heritage value or interest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This notice is being served to the Owner of the Property, the Ontario Heritage Trust, and any Objectors and Interested Persons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Reasons for Designation</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties at 49-59 Huntley Street are worthy of designation under Part IV, Section 29 of the Ontario Heritage Act for their cultural heritage value, and meet Ontario Regulation 9/06, the provincial criteria prescribed for municipal designation under the criteria of design/physical and contextual values.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The properties at 49-59 Huntley Street form part of a contiguous row of five near-identical, Victorian-era, Bay and Gable style, 2 1/2-storey homes (47-55 Huntley Street) attached to a slightly larger pair of near-identical, Victorian-era, Bay and Gable style, 2 1/2-storey homes (57-59 Huntley Street) - totalling a complete row of seven homes. All of the homes feature brick facades with brick detailing, wooden double-hung sash windows, transom windows, and decorative wooden gables with bargeboard detailing. Five of the seven homes within the row are configured as half bay and gables, as indicated by their one-storey bay windows paired with steep rooflines and decorative wooden gables - leaving a pair of taller, full bay and gable homes at the north end of the row. Some of the homes feature wrought iron dwarf parapets above their half bays. Considered as a row, the collection of homes date to the mid-1870s, and are among the earliest structures within the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Cultural Heritage Value</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The subject properties at 49-59 Huntley Street share considerable design value as part of a discreet, representative, collection of Victorian-era, half Bay and Gable style townhouses holding a significant degree of architectural integrity. The materiality and craftsmanship evident in the delicate brickwork (featuring raised courses of brick headers outlining architectural elements), and the mix of hand-carved and machine-turned millwork upon the wooden gables and bargeboard detailing, are all representative of a high degree of design and skilled execution.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contextually, the subject properties at 49-59 Huntley Street hold significant cultural heritage value as they collectively support and maintain the architectural character of the historic Upper Jarvis neighbourhood. Built 1874-1876, the subject properties are among the oldest surviving house-form structures in the vicinity, and together tell the story of the area's residential development during the late nineteenth century. Originally occupied by middle-class lawyers, bankers, civil engineers, and business owners, the subject properties are representative of the early demographic makeup of this fashionable corner of Victorian-era Toronto.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Heritage Attributes</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Design and Physical Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the value of the properties at 49-59 Huntley Street as a fine example of Toronto's late nineteenth-century Bay and Gable typology include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The scale, massing, and uniformity of the contiguous row of five townhouses and two semi-detached homes as defined by the subject properties</li>\n<li>The high degree of integrity present among the properties' extant original materials and architectural details - brick masonry, wooden gables and bargeboards, punched transom and double-hung sash windows, wrought iron dwarf parapets</li>\n<li>The use of decorative, raised, courses of brick used to trace architectural details such as the tops of windows; the use of brick arches overtop windows and doors</li>\n<li>The distinctive half Bay and Gable configuration of the row at 49-55 Huntley Street</li>\n<li>The prominent bargeboard detail of the semi-detached pair at 57-59 Huntley Street</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Contextual Value</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attributes that contribute to the contextual value of the properties at 49-59 Huntley Street as defining, supporting, and maintaining the historic character of the area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The consistency of typology, form, and function shared by the contiguous row of subject properties which creates a discreet collection of late nineteenth-century Bay and Gable homes along the east side of Huntley Street</li>\n<li>The reliance upon, and skilled use of, traditional materials including yellow brick, decorative woodwork, and wrought iron detailing, which support the late nineteenth-century character of the Upper Jarvis neighbourhood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Notice of Objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Notice of an objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property may be served on the City Clerk, Attention: Administrator, Secretariat, City Clerk's Office, Toronto City Hall, 2nd Floor West, 100 Queen Street West, Toronto, Ontario, M5H 2N2.; Email: <a href=\"mailto:hertpb@toronto.ca\">hertpb@toronto.ca</a> within thirty days of June 21, 2022, which is July 21, 2022. The notice of objection to the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property must set out the reason(s) for the objection and all relevant facts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Getting Additional Information:</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information in respect of the Notice of Intention to Designate the Property is available from the City of Toronto at:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.CC45.5\">http://app.toronto.ca/tmmis/viewAgendaItemHistory.do?item=2022.CC45.5</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
