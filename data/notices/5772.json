The in-force zoning and associated Section 37 agreement, approved in 1990, does not include a reallocation clause for unspent monies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is proposed to amend the Section 37 provision to allow for the potential reallocation of unspent Section 37 funds. The unspent monies secured in the amount of $213,747.92 is currently allocated towards streetscape improvements, and are proposed to be re-allocated towards their original purpose or for general park improvements, including a splashpad within the Ward.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, amendments to the site-specific zoning by-law listed above would include the same reallocation authority as found in other site-specific zoning by-laws enacted after 2013, to authorize reallocation of unspent funds at the discretion of the Chief Planner and Executive Director, City Planning in consultation with the Ward Councillor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No new development is proposed to the existing buildings at the above listed addresses as a result of these amendments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting Samuel Baron, Senior Planner, Community Planning at 416-392-4582, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Samuel.Baron@toronto.ca\">Samuel.Baron@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at <a href=\"https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2016.MM21.7\">https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2016.MM21.7</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Scarborough Community Council will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the application.
