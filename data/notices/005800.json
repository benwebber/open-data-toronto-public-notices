Minor modifications to aspects of the visitor parking standards are also proposed. A separate proposal to amend Zoning By-law 569-2013 to allow the amount of lawful parking spaces for non-residential uses at lawfully existing buildings to be reduced is also proposed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Amendment to Zoning By-law 569-2013 to Update Standards for Bicycle Parking, Accessible Parking and Visitor Parking</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed zoning by-law amendment will increase the amount of accessible parking in new developments by requiring at least 5% of automobile parking spaces to be accessible. The required proportions of accessible parking will be higher for medical offices, clinics, and residential developments in Parking Zone A. The amendment will require the accessible parking rates to be based on the number of dwelling units or gross floor area of non-residential developments to ensure a reasonable supply of accessible parking at all developments. The amendment will simplify the process of retrofitting existing parking spaces to become an accessible parking space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed zoning by-law amendment will also improve the quality of bicycle parking by introducing new requirements relating to aisle width, oversized bicycle parking, stacked and vertical racks restrictions, and access and paths to indoor bicycle parking. The amendment will provide flexibility for developments by expanding the Payment-in-lieu of Bicycle Parking program to all bicycle parking in residential development city-wide, reducing the requirements for shower and change facilities, removing the requirement for minimum three (3) short-term bicycle parking spaces for uses which have this requirement, and lowering the minimum width requirement of staggered bicycle parking spaces. The amendment will increase bicycle parking rates for education use, private school, public school, office and medical office uses as well as establish rates for residential care home, retirement home, nursing home, and student residence uses. For other uses that do not have bicycle parking requirements, a rate based on the number of automobile parking spaces will be applied.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The amendment will also reduce the visitor parking requirement for apartment buildings with 60 or fewer dwelling units on lots designated as neighbourhoods and abutting a major street, as shown on Official Plan Map 3, to one (1) visitor parking space.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Amendment to Zoning By-law 569-2013 to Update Standards for Automobile Parking</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The proposed zoning by-law amendment will allow the number of lawful parking spaces for non-residential uses to be reduced. The change is proposed to enable the commercial parking levy currently being considered by the City to achieve one of its objectives, namely a reduction in the parking supply to in turn encourage people to consider other modes for their travel.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These changes may affect the approval of building permits, zoning certificates or other applications for a minor variance, a consent to sever, an amendment to a zoning by-law, an Official Plan amendment or a Minister's zoning order and any appeals of these matters, as well as outstanding appeals of Zoning By-law 569-2013.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting Michael Hain, Program Manager, Transportation Planning, City Planning at 416-392-8698, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Michael.Hain@toronto.ca\">Michael.Hain@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/parkingreview\">https://www.toronto.ca/parkingreview</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the proposed Zoning By-law Amendment.&nbsp; These recommendations will then be forwarded to Toronto City Council for its consideration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can follow the meeting at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive\">www.youtube.com/TorontoCityCouncilLive</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>MAKE YOUR VIEWS KNOWN</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You may send written comments by e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:phc@toronto.ca\">phc@toronto.ca</a> or by mail to the address below.
