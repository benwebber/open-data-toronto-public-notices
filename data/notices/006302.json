The OPA would streamline multiple existing multiplex policies into a single set of policies guiding multiplex development city-wide.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>City-wide Zoning By-law 569-2013 would be amended to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow multiplexes with up to six units in detached residential buildings in the R, RD, RS, RT, and RM zones, subject to standards related to height, setbacks, and building depth, among others; and</li>\n<li>Change the definition of an &ldquo;apartment building&rdquo; to mean a building with seven or more dwelling units.<br />&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These amendments will be considered at the same meeting as amendments proposed by the Multiplex Monitoring Program to improve implementation and facilitate multiplex construction.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material may be obtained by contacting Kasia Kmiec at 416-392-0674 or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Kasia.Kmiec@toronto.ca\">Kasia.Kmiec@toronto.ca</a> and Brooke Marshall at 416-397-4075 or by email at <a href=\"mailto:Brooke.Marshall@toronto.ca\">Brooke.Marshall@toronto.ca</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/multiplex\">www.toronto.ca/multiplex</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the application.
