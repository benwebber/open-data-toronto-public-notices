  "noticeDescription": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>NOTICE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>To be held by the Planning and Housing Committee</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>(Under the Planning Act)</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Recommended Official Plan Amendment to amend Chapters 2.3 and 4.3 of the Official Plan</strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>Date: </strong><strong>September 26, 2024</strong><br /><strong>Time: </strong><strong>9:30 a.m. or as soon as possible thereafter</strong><br /><strong>Place: </strong><strong>Committee Room 1, Toronto City Hall and by Video Conference</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PROPOSAL</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lands designated as Parks and Open Space Areas in the Official Plan accommodate natural habitat areas, important ecological services and many of the City's recreation opportunities. They are essential to health, prosperity, and quality of life in our City and receive a high level of protection in the Official Plan.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The purpose of this recommended Official Plan Amendment is to identify limited exemptions when the sale or disposal of City-owned lands in Parks and Open Space Areas, within or outside of the Green Space System, may be permitted without an Official Plan Amendment (OPA). The recommended amendment intends to facilitate conservation projects and essential public works and utilities that support Toronto's development and growth provided certain criteria are met.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recommended Official Plan Amendment would help modernize the process. It introduces new criteria, which, if met, would remove the need for a public agency or utility provider to seek an OPA as a precondition to undertaking a land transaction for a conservation project or to construct essential underground public works and utilities in Parks and Open Space Areas. It will amend policies in Chapters 2.3 and 4.3 of the Official Plan with updates that address the evolving challenges confronting the City to provide public infrastructure for the growth in the City.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recommended Official Plan Amendment has been informed through public, stakeholder, and Indigenous engagement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the recommended Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Brandon Paniccia, Project Coordinator at <a href=\"mailto:Brandon.Paniccia@toronto.ca\">Brandon.Paniccia@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The draft Official Plan Amendment is also available starting on September 6, 2024, at: <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/infrastructure-improvements-in-parks-open-space-areas-the-green-space-system/\">https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/planning-studies-initiatives/infrastructure-improvements-in-parks-open-space-areas-the-green-space-system/</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the amendment.
