A copy of the current Official Plan can be viewed or downloaded from the City's website: <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/official-plan/\">https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/official-plan-guidelines/official-plan/</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of the City of Toronto&rsquo;s MCR/Conformity Exercise, this proposed Official Plan Amendment is in conformity with the A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe (2020), is consistent with the Provincial Policy Statement (2020), and has regard to matters of provincial interest under Section 2 of the <em>Planning Act</em>. If adopted by Council, the proposed Official Plan Amendment will be submitted to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing for approval pursuant to Section 26 of the <em>Planning Act</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <em>Planning Act</em> requires that if an Official Plan is being revised under Section 26 of that Act, a Special Public Meeting must be held on any proposed amendments to revise the Official Plan and that an Open House be held if the Official Plan is being revised to ensure that the public has an opportunity to review and ask questions about the information and material made available in advance of the Special Public Meeting. The holding of public hearings on the Official Plan Amendment may be delegated by Council to the Planning and Housing Committee under Section 24 of the <em>City of Toronto Act, 2006</em> and the <em>Toronto Municipal Code</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Official Plan is substantially in conformity with relevant and applicable provincial plans and policy requirements related to the economy, economic growth, and employment areas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The MCR includes a process to review and evaluate requests to convert lands from an <em>Employment Areas</em> designation to non-employment uses or to broaden permitted uses. As part of this conversion request process, the City received approximately 150 requests to convert lands designated <em>Core Employment Areas</em> or <em>General Employment Areas</em> for non-employment uses. The year-long City Council approved window to receive conversion requests closed on August 3, 2021.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Planning and Housing Committee authorized the use of over 130 preliminary assessments of employment conversion requests for the basis of consultation. The conversion request preliminary assessments were advanced in four consecutive groupings between January and April 2022. The conversion request at 21 Don Roadway, 30 Booth Avenue and 375 and 385 Eastern Avenue was considered in Group 1: 39 Preliminary Assessments (January 12, 2022) available at <a href=\"https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2022.PH30.5\">https://secure.toronto.ca/council/agenda-item.do?item=2022.PH30.5</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The City has taken a phased approach to reporting the final recommendations for the conversion requests. The first batch of conversion requests was previously considered at the Statutory Public Meeting at the July 5, 2022 Planning and Housing Committee, the second batch of conversion requests was previously considered at a Statutory Public Meeting at the June 1, 2023 meeting of the Planning and Housing Committee and the third batch of conversion requests was previously considered at a Statutory Public Meeting at the July 5, 2023 meeting of the Planning and Housing Committee.&nbsp; The consideration of eight conversion requests, including the one for 21 Don Roadway, 30 Booth Avenue and 375 &amp; 385 Eastern Avenue (East Harbour lands) were deferred to a later date.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Staff's final recommendations for the conversion request at 21 Don Roadway, 30 Booth Avenue and 375 &amp; 385 Eastern Avenue includes amendments to the Official Plan. A proposed Official Plan Amendment (OPA) to implement staff's recommendations is being brought forward to the Statutory Public Meeting at the September 28, 2023 Planning and Housing Committee. The proposed OPA 683 would amend Map 2 (Urban Structure); Map 18 (Land Use Plan); and provide a further layer of local policy direction for the lands by revising Chapter&nbsp;6, Section 42, (Unilever Precinct Secondary Plan) and Chapter 7 (Site and Area Specific Policy 426). A map of the lands is provided in this notice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information, including a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment (starting on September 1, 2023) may be obtained by contacting Janani Mahendran, Senior Planner, at 416-338-3003, or by eâ€‘mail at <a href=\"mailto:Janani.Mahendran@toronto.ca\">Janani.Mahendran@toronto.ca</a>.
