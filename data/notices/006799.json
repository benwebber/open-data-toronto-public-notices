The purpose is to foster more opportunities for housing, services, and local businesses near transit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The effect of the proposed City-initiated Official Plan Amendments is to redesignate certain lands as described above from <em>Neighborhoods</em> to either <em>Apartment Neighbourhoods</em> or <em>Mixed Use Areas</em> to enable permissions for mid-rise buildings along these aforementioned Avenues in Wards 9 and 11.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The lands subject to this amendment are located both within and outside of Protected Major Transit Station Areas PMTSAs (see below). The City is recommending two Official Plan Amendments and two Zoning By-law Amendments: one set respecting lands within Protected Major Transit Station Areas (PMTSAs) for which the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing is the approval authority, and one set respecting lands outside a PMTSA for which City Council is the approval authority.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The purpose and effect of the recommended City-initiated Zoning By-law Amendments is to facilitate permissions for mid-rise buildings (up to six-storeys) for these lands. These City-initiated Zoning By-law Amendments would rezone the lands to the CR zone in Zoning By-law 569-2013 and apply Development Standard Set 4 where they are recommended to be redesignated to Mixed Use Areas. Where lands already have a Commercial Residential (CR) zone, the recommended City-initiated Zoning By-law Amendments will apply the same Development Standard Set 4 of the CR zone in Zoning By-law 569-2013 to permit updated height, floor space index, and other development standards. It is recommended that there be no zoning change for lands recommended to be redesignated to Apartment Neighbourhoods. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed information regarding the proposal, including background information and material and a copy of the proposed Official Plan Amendment may be obtained by contacting Valeria Maurizio, Senior Planner, Policy and Research, at 416-395-7052, or by e-mail at <a href=\"mailto:Valeria.Maurizio@toronto.ca\">Valeria.Maurizio@toronto.ca</a>.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.toronto.ca/Avenues\">http://www.toronto.ca/Avenues</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>PURPOSE OF PUBLIC MEETING</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Planning and Housing Committee will receive input and review the proposal and any other material placed before it, in order to make recommendations on the proposed Official Plan and Zoning By-law Amendments.
